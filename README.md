Getting-And-Cleaning-Data-Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

Script:

run_analysis.R

At R prompt, load above script and run doall()

In working directory two files are produced - TidySet1.txt and TidySet2.txt.

TidySet2.txt represents the independent tidy data set with the 
             average of each variable for each activity and each subject
             each value is comma-separated.
